# Movies

## Local Setup
### JS App
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Visit `localhost:3000`. Notice the routes set up in `App.js`. These routes must be retained as the app is developed.

## Routes
There are 2 main routes to the JS app:
1. Root `/`: This should display a list of movies available
   A. Display the movie image, title, rating
   B. Sort by rating
2. Movie detail `/movie/${id}`: This displays details of the movie that matches `id`
   A. Display all available fields for the matching movie

## Folders

1. `src` - Contains the react app and all its components
